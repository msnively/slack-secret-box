# slack-secret-box
A _very_ simple way to anonymously save messages sent via a slash command in Slack and later retrieve them.

Designed for use in an Agile/Scrum environment, this provides a way for team members to quickly add anonymous notes to a database that can only be accessed during (or after) the sprint retrospective. 

The storage system is tied to Slack channels so one user can participate in adding notes to multiple retrospectives.
